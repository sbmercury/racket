This is a simple project designed to track transactions. I needed a way to track transactions that my parents would reimburse me for and remind them about those transactions, this app allows me to quickly add and remove transactions and automatically sends reminder emails to both me and them.

This app uses:

NodeJS/Express

MongoDB (for storing transactions)

SendGrid (for sending reminder emails)

Node Schedule (for running recurring tasks)


My personal version uses Jenkins to automatically deploy changes to a DigitalOcean VPS that it's hosted on.
